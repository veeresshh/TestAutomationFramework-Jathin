## Setup Instructions

**Clone the Repository:**

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/veeresshh/TestAutomationFramework-Jathin.git

  cd TestAutomationFramework
```
    

**Running Tests on LambdaTest:**

```bash
     mvn test  -Dbrowser=chrome -DisLambdaTest=true -DisHeadless=false -X

```


**Running Tests on Chrome browser on Local Machine in Headless Mode:**

```bash
     mvn test  -Dbrowser=chrome -DisLambdaTest=false -DisHeadless=true -X

```

## Reports & Logs
-Reports: After execution, a detailed HTML report will be generated at ./report.html. 

The report contains information on test cases executed, passed, failed, and skipped, along with screenshots for failed tests.

## Logs:
